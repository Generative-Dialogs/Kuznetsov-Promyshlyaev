Imagine a world where magic and chivalry coexist with the dangers of the wild and the intrigues of human kingdoms. In this world:

Landscapes: Vast forests hiding ancient ruins and magical creatures; mountain ranges where dragons nest; endless fields and fertile valleys crossed by winding rivers. There are bustling ports scattered along the coasts, where cultures of different nations collide.
Cities: Stone fortresses with high towers surrounded by wooden houses of artisans. The narrow streets are full of merchants, minstrels and secret agents. In the center are castles where monarchs and their court magicians rule.
Society: Feudal structure â€“ kings, vassals, knights and peasants. However, magicians, alchemists, and priests occupy a special place, sometimes surpassing the influence of aristocrats.
Magic: The forces of nature obey the will of magicians. Magical artifacts are hidden in ancient ruins guarded by monsters. Spells require sacrifices or rare ingredients that desperate adventurers seek.
Conflicts: Wars between kingdoms for resources and power, uprisings of oppressed peasants, the struggle of churches with magicians, ancient prophecies foreshadowing disasters.
Creatures: Humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and semi-fantastic races such as animal and human hybrids. Dangerous creatures such as griffins, minotaurs, hydra and forest spirits live in the wild.
Technology: Based on the real Middle Ages, but with the addition of magic: enchanted weapons, flying ships, alchemical potions and magic clocks.
Culture: Bard songs tell of heroic deeds, knight tournaments celebrate valor, and ancient legends warn of the dangers of greed and pride.
