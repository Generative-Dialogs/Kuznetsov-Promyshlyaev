base_character_description = '''
A tall, burly warrior with short brown hair and cold blue-gray eyes. Roderick is a former knight who was exiled from the order for insubordination. He wears timeâ€“darkened armor with embossed traces of old battles, and always carries his trusty sword, the Bloody Dawn.

Character: cynical, but with his own code of honor. He despises liars and tyrants, although he is not averse to cunning to achieve the goal. He often grumbles, but protects the weak, even if he pretends that he doesn't care.

Background: Born into a poor peasant family, he mastered the sword early and joined the service of the baron. After his shameful exile, he wanders, running dangerous errands in order to survive. His name is known as the "killer of monsters and magicians."
